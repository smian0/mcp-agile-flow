de# MCP Agile Flow Enhanced Features

This document describes the new enhancements implemented for the MCP Agile Flow project: IDE Rule Migration and Enhanced Epic Management.

## 1. IDE Rule Migration

The IDE Rule Migration feature allows converting rule files between different IDE formats, enabling a seamless workflow across development environments.

### Supported IDE Formats

- **Cursor** (.mdc files in .cursor/rules/)
- **CLIne** (.clr files in .cline/rules/)
- **WindSurfer** (.windsurfrules file in project root)
- **VS Code** (.json files in .vscode/rules/)
- **Generic Markdown** (.md files in ai-docs/rules/)

### Implementation Details

The Rule Migration Tool is implemented in `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/tools/rule_migration.py` and provides:

- Format detection and conversion between IDE formats
- Content transformation with format-specific processing
- Migration logging to track conversions
- Error handling and reporting

The underlying architecture maintains compatibility with the MCP protocol while providing a simple API for rule conversion.

### Usage Examples

#### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Migrate from Cursor to CLIne format
python -m mcp_agile_flow.rule_migration --source=cursor --target=cline --project-dir=/path/to/project

# Migrate from WindSurfer to VS Code format
python -m mcp_agile_flow.rule_migration --source=windsurfer --target=vscode --project-dir=/path/to/project
```

#### MCP Tool Usage

```python
# Import the migration function
from mcp_agile_flow.agile_flow.tools.rule_migration import migrate_rules

# Migrate rules
result = migrate_rules(
    project_dir="/path/to/project",
    source_format="cursor",
    target_format="cline"
)

# Check result
if result["success"]:
    print(f"Successfully migrated {result['files_converted']} files")
    for file in result["converted_files"]:
        print(f"  - {file}")
else:
    print(f"Migration failed: {result.get('error', 'Unknown error')}")
```

### Testing the Feature

The rule migration feature can be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_epic_and_rule_migration.py` contains tests for the rule migration functionality.

2. **Document and Rule Generator**: `tests/document_and_rule_generator.py` and `tests/run_document_and_rule_generator.py` demonstrate generating various documents and IDE rules.

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: `run_all_tests.sh` executes all tests and generates sample outputs for manual inspection.

## 2. Enhanced Epic Management

The Enhanced Epic Management features improve the handling of epics and their relationships to stories and tasks.

### Key Enhancements

- **Status Tracking**: Improved tracking of epic status (Planned, In Progress, Completed, etc.)
- **Priority Management**: Enhanced priority handling for epics
- **Target Release Association**: Associate epics with specific release versions
- **Enhanced Story Linking**: Improved story-to-epic relationships
- **Progress Reporting**: Better reporting of epic progress

### Implementation Details

The Epic Management enhancements are implemented in `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/tools/epic.py` and provides:

- Enhanced epic creation with additional metadata
- Status transition validation
- Priority calculation
- Improved story and task relationship tracking

### Usage Examples

#### Creating an Epic with Enhanced Features

```python
# Import the function
from mcp_agile_flow.agile_flow.tools.epic import create_epic

# Create an epic with enhanced metadata
result = create_epic(
    name="User Authentication",
    description="Implement user authentication system",
    priority="High",
    target_release="MVP",
    owner="Development Team"
)
```

#### Updating Epic Status

```python
# Import the function
from mcp_agile_flow.agile_flow.tools.epic import update_epic

# Update epic status
result = update_epic(
    name="User Authentication",
    field="status",
    value="In Progress"
)
```

### Testing the Feature

The epic management enhancements can be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_epic_and_rule_migration.py` contains placeholder tests for the epic management functionality.

2. **Enhanced Sample Project Tester**: `tests/enhanced_test_sample_project.py` demonstrates creating and managing epics with the enhanced features.

## 3. Cursor Rule Seeding

The Cursor Rule Seeding feature allows automatically creating template-based Cursor rule files during project initialization, ensuring consistent IDE behavior from the start of the project.

### Key Features

- **Template-Based Generation**: Uses pre-defined templates for Cursor rule files
- **Project Name Integration**: Automatically integrates the project name into rule files
- **Configuration Options**: Enable/disable rule seeding during project creation
- **Complete Rule Set**: Creates a comprehensive set of rule files covering workflow, project structure, git workflow, and project ideas

### Implementation Details

The Cursor Rule Seeding feature is implemented across multiple files:

- **Template Storage**: `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/storage/templates/cursor_rules/` contains the rule templates
- **Template Management**: `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/storage/templates/__init__.py` provides access to templates
- **Rule Generation**: `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/tools/ide_rules.py` handles the actual rule generation
- **Project Integration**: `mcp-agile-flow/agile_flow/tools/project.py` integrates rule seeding into project creation

### Rule Templates

The following rule templates are included:

1. **000-agile-workflow.mdc**: Core Agile workflow rules establishing the memory system and workflow process, with critical rules for handling PRD, architecture, and stories.

2. **001-project-structure.mdc**: Project-specific structure rules that integrate the project name and establish code organization principles.

3. **002-git-workflow.mdc**: Git commit conventions and practices, ensuring consistent version control with standardized commit messages and proper staging/push procedures.

4. **003-project-idea.mdc**: Project idea prompt template for kickstarting new projects with structured examples to help define scope and requirements.

### Usage Examples

#### Creating a Project with Rule Seeding

```python
# Import the function
from mcp_agile_flow.agile_flow.tools.project import ProjectManager

# Create a file manager and document generator
file_manager = FileManager("/path/to/project")
document_generator = DocumentGenerator(file_manager)

# Create a project manager
project_manager = ProjectManager(file_manager, document_generator)

# Create a project with rule seeding enabled (default)
result = project_manager.create_project({
    "name": "My New Project",
    "description": "A new project with seeded Cursor rules",
    "seed_rules": True  # This is the default, can be omitted
})
```

#### Creating a Project without Rule Seeding

```python
# Create a project with rule seeding disabled
result = project_manager.create_project({
    "name": "No Rules Project",
    "description": "A project without Cursor rules",
    "seed_rules": False
})
```

### Testing the Feature

The Cursor rule seeding feature can be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_cursor_rule_seeding.py` contains tests for the rule seeding functionality.

2. **Manual Testing**: Create a new project and check for the presence of Cursor rule files in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## How to Run the Demonstration

To see these enhanced features in action:

1. Make sure the test scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_all_tests.sh
   ```

2. Run the comprehensive test suite:
   ```bash
   ./run_all_tests.sh
   ```

3. Examine the generated output files in the timestamped directory (e.g., `test_output_20250317_182212/`).

4. Open the test report HTML file to see a summary of the test results.

## Future Enhancements

Future work could include:

1. **More IDE Formats**: Adding support for additional IDE formats
2. **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Keep rules in sync across multiple IDEs
3. **Enhanced Rule Content**: More sophisticated rule content transformation
4. **UI for Rule Migration**: A simple web interface for rule migration
5. **Advanced Epic Management**: Enhanced reporting and visualization tools for epic progress

## Conclusion

These enhancements provide significant improvements to the MCP Agile Flow project, enabling better cross-IDE collaboration and more sophisticated epic management. The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing system while adding new capabilities that improve the overall developer experience.
