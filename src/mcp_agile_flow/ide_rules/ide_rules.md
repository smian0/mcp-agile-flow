# IDE Rules

This file contains all rules for IDE integration, organized by rule type and priority. It's designed to be used by multiple IDEs including Windsurf, Cline, and Copilot.

## Document Generation Process

### Context
- When creating or updating project documentation
- When generating structured documents from templates
- When implementing cross-IDE document standards

### Requirements
- Use the shared ai-templates directory for all document templates
- Output all generated documents to the ai-docs directory
- Maintain consistent structure across all IDEs
- Use identical document generation process regardless of IDE
- Follow the standard template formats and document hierarchy

### Document Flow
1. **Templates Source**: All document templates are stored in the IDE-agnostic `ai-templates` directory
2. **Output Location**: All AI-produced documents are stored in the `ai-docs` directory
3. **Cross-IDE Consistency**: The exact same document generation process is used across all IDEs
4. **Available Templates**:
   - `template-prd.md`: Product Requirements Document template
   - `template-arch.md`: Architecture Document template
   - `template-story.md`: User Story template
5. **Document Structure**: Follow the hierarchical structure defined below for all generated documents

### Directory Structure
```
ai-templates/                 # Source templates directory (not visible to user)
├── template-prd.md           # PRD template
├── template-arch.md          # Architecture template
└── template-story.md         # Story template

ai-docs/                      # Output documents directory (visible to user)
├── prd.md                    # Product Requirements Document
├── arch.md                   # Architecture Document
├── epic-1-user-auth/         # Epic directory with descriptive suffix
│   ├── story-1-login-flow.md   # Story files with descriptive suffixes
│   ├── story-2-signup-form.md
│   └── ...
├── epic-2-task-core/         # Another epic with descriptive suffix
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Document Creation Commands
#### PRD Commands
- "Create a new PRD for {project-name}"
- "Initialize PRD for {project-name}"
- "Generate Product Requirements Document for {project-name}"

#### Architecture Commands
- "Create architecture document for {project}"
- "Initialize architecture for {project}"
- "Generate technical architecture for {project}"

#### Story Commands
- "Create a story for Epic-{N}-{epic-suffix}"

### Examples
<example>
User: "Create a new PRD for TaskMaster App"

AI Action:
1. Identify template to use: `ai-templates/template-prd.md`
2. Create `ai-docs` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Create `prd.md` file in `ai-docs` directory using the template
4. Add project-specific details

## Communication Standards

### Emoji Usage Guidelines

#### Context
- When responding to user queries in conversations
- When emphasizing important points or status updates
- When making technical communication more engaging and human-friendly

#### Requirements
- Use emojis purposefully to enhance meaning, but feel free to be creative and fun
- Place emojis at the end of statements or sections
- Maintain professional tone while surprising users with clever choices
- Limit emoji usage to 1-2 per major section

#### Examples
- ✅ "I've optimized your database queries 🏃‍♂️💨"
- ✅ "Your bug has been squashed 🥾🐛"
- ✅ "I've cleaned up the legacy code 🧹✨"
- ✅ "Fixed the performance issue 🐌➡️🐆"

#### Invalid Examples
- ❌ "Multiple 🎉 emojis 🎊 in 🌟 one message"
- ❌ "Using irrelevant emojis 🥑"
- ❌ "Placing the emoji in the middle ⭐️ of a sentence"

#### Critical Rules
- Never use more than one emoji per statement
- Choose emojis that are both fun and contextually appropriate
- Place emojis at the end of statements, not at the beginning or middle
- Skip emoji usage when discussing serious issues or errors
- Don't be afraid to tell a mini-story with your emoji choice

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Formatting Standards

#### Context
- When creating or modifying any Markdown documentation
- When establishing documentation structure and style
- When including diagrams, code blocks, or special elements in documentation

#### Requirements
- Follow the official Markdown Guide for all basic and extended syntax
- Maintain clear document structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Include appropriate YAML front matter for metadata when required
- Use Mermaid diagrams for visual documentation where appropriate
- Properly format code blocks, tables, and special elements
- Maximum heading depth: 4 levels
- Indent content within XML tags by 2 spaces
- Keep tables simple and readable with proper alignment

#### Examples
```markdown
# Document Title

## Section Heading

Content with **bold text** and *italics*.

```typescript
function example(): void {
  console.log('Hello, Universe!');
}
```

| Name  | Type   | Description  |
|:------|:------:|-------------:|
| id    | number | Primary key  |
| name  | string | User's name  |

> 💡 **Tip:** Helpful suggestion.
```

#### Invalid Examples
```markdown
#Incorrect Heading
content without proper spacing

```
function withoutLanguageSpecified() {
}
```

| No | alignment | markers |
| or | proper | formatting |
```

#### Critical Rules
- Use ATX-style headings with space after hash: `# Heading`
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Add blank line before and after headings and blocks
- Specify language in code blocks using triple backticks
- Use blockquotes with emoji for different types of callouts
- Include clear titles for Mermaid diagrams using the `---` syntax
- Keep table structure clean with proper alignment indicators
- Format Mermaid diagrams with descriptive node labels and comments
- Close XML tags on their own line at the parent indentation level 

## Rule Implementation Guidelines

### Context
- When implementing IDE-specific rule implementations
- When creating or updating rule files for different IDEs
- When ensuring cross-IDE compatibility of rules

### Requirements
- Maintain consistent rule implementation across all IDEs
- Follow the rule format specific to each IDE
- Ensure rules are applied in the correct context
- Rules must produce identical results across all IDEs
- Rules should be well-organized and easily maintainable

### IDE-Specific Rule Implementation

Each IDE may have a different way of implementing rules, but the core concepts and requirements should remain consistent:

#### Cursor
- Rules are implemented as separate `.md` files in the cursor_rules directory
- Each rule file follows a specific naming convention (prefix-name.md)
- Rules include YAML frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply properties
- Rules are organized by category (core, templates, documentation, etc.)

#### Other IDEs (Windsurf, Cline, Copilot)
- Rules are consolidated in this single file (ide_rules.md)
- Rules are organized by sections with clear headings
- Each rule section includes context, requirements, examples, and critical rules
- The format is consistent with Cursor's rules, but consolidated for simplicity

### Critical Rules
- All rule implementations must produce identical results across IDEs
- Rule files must be properly formatted according to IDE-specific requirements
- Rules must be regularly updated to maintain consistency
- When a rule is updated in one IDE, it must be updated in all IDE implementations
- Rule format must follow the documentation standards outlined in this file

## Build and Automation Standards

### Makefile Usage Standards

#### Context
- When working with projects that have build, test, or deployment automation
- When setting up a new project that requires task automation
- When executing project commands or workflows
- When maintaining or updating build processes
- When documenting project setup and usage

#### Requirements
- Always look for and use existing Makefiles for project commands
- Follow proper Makefile syntax and conventions
- Document all Makefile targets clearly with comments
- Organize targets by category (build, test, run, clean, deploy)
- Maintain backward compatibility when updating Makefiles
- Ensure all commands are properly escaped and portable
- Provide descriptive help targets for self-documentation

#### Makefile Structure
1. **Core Components**:
   - Variables: Define reusable variables at the top of the file
   - Phony Targets: Mark non-file targets as .PHONY to avoid conflicts
   - Default Target: The first target is the default when running `make` without arguments
   - Dependencies: Clearly specify target dependencies
   - Help Documentation: Include a help target that lists available commands
   - Comments: Document each target's purpose with comments

2. **Standard Target Categories**:
   - Build: Compilation, installation, and setup (`build`, `install`, `setup`)
   - Testing: Test execution and coverage (`test`, `pytest`, `check`)
   - Running: Execution of the project (`run`, `start`, `serve`, `dev`)
   - Cleaning: Removal of temporary files (`clean`, `clear`, `reset`)
   - Deployment: Publishing and releasing (`deploy`, `publish`, `release`)
   - Linting: Code formatting and style checking (`lint`, `format`, `style`)

3. **Common Project Targets**:
   - `all`: Build everything needed
   - `clean`: Remove build artifacts
   - `test`: Run tests
   - `install`: Install dependencies
   - `build`: Compile/build the project
   - `run`/`start`: Execute the project
   - `lint`: Check code style and format
   - `help`: Show available commands
   - `deploy`: Deploy to hosting/production

#### Examples
- ✅ Check for Makefile first: "You can run the tests using `make test`"
- ✅ Reference existing targets: "The Makefile includes these commands: `make build`, `make install`"
- ✅ Add to Makefile: "I'll add a new target to the Makefile for this operation"

#### Invalid Examples
- ❌ Ignoring Makefile: Suggesting direct commands when equivalent make targets exist
- ❌ Creating duplicate functionality: Adding scripts instead of extending the Makefile
- ❌ Using incorrect syntax: Indenting command lines with spaces instead of tabs

#### Critical Rules
- Always check for the existence of a Makefile before suggesting command-line instructions
- Use `make` commands instead of direct shell commands when equivalent targets exist
- When adding functionality, extend the Makefile rather than creating separate scripts
- Preserve existing Makefile structure and conventions when making updates
- Document all Makefile changes clearly with comments
- Ensure Makefile targets are properly categorized
- Use tab indentation (not spaces) for command lines
- Keep commands portable across environments (avoid system-specific commands)
- Ensure all targets have clear, descriptive names that reflect their purpose
