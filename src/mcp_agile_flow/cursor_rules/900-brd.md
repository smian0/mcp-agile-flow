# Business Requirements Documentation

## Context
- When user asks to create a Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- When updating an existing BRD
- When analyzing business requirements for a project
- When positioning requirements in the documentation hierarchy

## Requirements
- BRD must be created and maintained at the highest level of the document hierarchy
- BRD should link to the PRD when available
- All required sections must be included
- Document must follow standardized formatting
- Document must be placed in the ai-docs directory
- Document must use the official template

## BRD Structure

The BRD establishes the business context and rationale for a project. It sits above the PRD in the documentation hierarchy and focuses on:

1. **Executive Summary**: Concise overview of the business need and solution approach
2. **Business Objectives**: Clear, measurable business goals driving the project
3. **Market Problem Analysis**: Detailed examination of market gaps and customer pain points
4. **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable measures of project success with baseline and target values
5. **Customer Needs**: Segmented analysis of user requirements
6. **Business Constraints**: Limitations on budget, time, resources, technology, and regulations
7. **Assumptions**: Explicit business, market, technical, and resource assumptions
8. **Stakeholders**: Key stakeholders with roles, responsibilities, and decision authority
9. **Related Documents**: Links to supporting documents, particularly the PRD

## Document Status Flow

The BRD follows a defined status progression:
1. **Draft**: Initial creation and iteration
2. **In Review**: Shared with stakeholders for feedback
3. **Approved**: Finalized and accepted by key stakeholders
4. **Superseded**: When replaced by a newer version

## Implementation Guidance

### When Creating a BRD

1. Use the template from `.ai-templates/template-brd.md`
2. Ensure all required sections are included
3. Document should be stored in `ai-docs/brd.md`
4. Input specific project information where indicated by placeholders
5. Set status to "Draft" during initial creation
6. Generate the current date for "Created" and "Last Updated" fields
7. Set initial version to 0.1

### When Updating a BRD

1. Preserve the original structure
2. Update only specific sections as needed
3. Increment the version number appropriately
   - Minor changes: 0.1 → 0.2
   - Significant changes: 0.9 → 1.0
4. Update the "Last Updated" date
5. Update status if appropriate
6. Add links to PRD once available

### When Linking Documents

1. BRD should link to the PRD in the "Related Documents" section
2. PRD should reference the BRD to maintain bidirectional links
3. Both documents should maintain consistent project nomenclature
