## Document Control
- **Status:** Draft
- **Created:** 2023-03-15
- **Last Updated:** 2023-03-18
- **Version:** 0.1

## Executive Summary

The Imperial Defense Platform v2 (IDP2) addresses critical security gaps in our galactic defense infrastructure. The Empire faces increasing threats from rebel factions exploiting vulnerabilities in our current installations. IDP2 will serve as both a military deterrent and a symbol of Imperial authority, providing unprecedented defensive capabilities while projecting Imperial power throughout key systems.

## Business Objectives

- Increase Imperial territorial control by 35% within core systems
- Reduce rebel incursion success rate from 24% to <5%
- Improve response time to security threats by 75%
- Decrease planetary garrison requirements by 60%
- Achieve 300% ROI within 5 standard years through reduced military expenditures

## Market Problem Analysis

- Current defense platforms lack sufficient firepower to deter organized rebel fleets
- Rebel propaganda effectiveness increased 43% due to perception of Imperial vulnerability
- Strategic systems remaining under-protected due to resource limitations
- Intelligence reports indicate rebel planning for large-scale coordinated attacks
- Competing powers developing advanced weapons technology at accelerated pace

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Territorial Control | 65% of target systems | 95% of target systems | Quarterly territorial surveys |
| Rebel Incursion Success | 24% | <5% | Security incident reports |
| Response Time | 4.3 hours | 1.1 hours | Defense system logs |
| Garrison Troop Requirements | 1.2M troops | 0.5M troops | Resource allocation system |
| Annual Military Budget | 15.7T credits | 12.2T credits | Imperial Treasury reports |

## Customer Needs

- Imperial High Command requires centralized command capabilities
- Regional Governors need visible security presence to maintain order
- Imperial Navy requires advanced docking and repair facilities
- Intelligence Division needs enhanced surveillance capabilities
- Civilian contractors need safe operational environments

## Business Constraints

- Maximum budget allocation of 1 trillion credits per fiscal year
- Project timeline not to exceed 6 standard years
- Must utilize existing supply chains and manufacturing infrastructure
- All technologies must comply with Imperial security protocols
- Minimum disruption to existing military operations during construction

## Assumptions

- Political support from Imperial Senate will remain stable
- Required kyber crystal resources remain accessible
- Shipyard capacity will be available as scheduled
- Technical expertise can be sourced from existing Imperial Academy graduates
- Rebel forces will not significantly change tactics during construction phase

## Stakeholders

| Role | Department | Responsibilities |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Emperor Palpatine | Imperial Throne | Final approval authority |
| Grand Moff Tarkin | Imperial Security | Executive sponsor, resource allocation |
| Admiral Piett | Imperial Navy | Operational requirements, integration planning |
| Director Krennic | Advanced Weapons | Technical oversight, construction management |
| Lord Vader | Executive Office | Special requirements, performance evaluation |
