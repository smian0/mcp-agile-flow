# FastMCP Migration Summary

## Completed Migrations

We have successfully migrated the following tools from the legacy implementation in `server.py` to the FastMCP framework:

### Previously Migrated Tools
- `get_project_settings`
- `get_mermaid_diagram`
- `read_graph`
- `initialize_ide`
- `prime_context`
- `migrate_mcp_config`

### Newly Migrated Tools
- `initialize_ide_rules`
- Knowledge Graph Management Tools:
  - `create_entities`
  - `create_relations`
  - `add_observations` 
  - `delete_entities`
  - `delete_observations`
  - `delete_relations`
  - `search_nodes`
  - `open_nodes`

## Implementation Details

All migrated tools follow a consistent pattern:
1. Each tool is implemented as a Python function in `fastmcp_tools.py`
2. Function parameters match the tool's expected arguments
3. Returns a JSON-formatted string with standard success/error response format
4. Includes proper error handling and logging
5. The `server.py` file has been updated to delegate calls to these tools to their FastMCP implementations

## Testing

- Unit tests for the Knowledge Graph tools are passing
- Direct testing of the FastMCP functions confirms they work as expected
- The server implementation has been updated to bypass the original implementation for all migrated tools

## Benefits of Migration

- Consistent error handling pattern across all tools
- Cleaner separation of concerns between server infrastructure and tool logic
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Better integration with the FastMCP framework

## Next Steps

All planned tool migrations have been completed. The codebase is now ready for the next phase of development.
