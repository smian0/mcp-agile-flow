# Epic-7: Memory Graph Removal

## Status
Completed

## Description
This epic focuses on removing the Memory Graph functionality from the MCP Agile Flow server. The memory graph functionality will be moved to a separate MCP server to reduce clutter and simplify the core MCP Agile Flow implementation. This removal will include all related code, tests, and dependencies to ensure a clean separation.

## Objectives
- Remove all memory graph functionality from the MCP Agile Flow server
- Ensure the core functionality continues to work without the memory graph
- Maintain clean architecture with no residual dependencies
- Update documentation to reflect the changes
- Create a comprehensive test plan to validate the removal

## Stories
- Story-1-remove-memory-graph-core: Remove memory graph core implementation
- Story-2-remove-server-integration: Remove memory graph integration with simple server
- Story-3-remove-tests: Remove memory graph tests and update test suite
- Story-4-update-docs: Update documentation to reflect memory graph removal

## Technical Considerations
- The memory graph functionality is currently integrated in `memory_graph.py`
- The memory graph is initialized in `server.py` and `run_mcp_server.py`
- Various tools are registered with the MCP server in `register_memory_tools()`
- Tests specific to the memory graph are in `test_memory_graph.py`
- Documentation in `arch.md` and `prd.md` references the memory graph

## Acceptance Criteria
- All memory graph code is completely removed
- MCP server runs successfully without any references to memory graph
- All tests pass after memory graph removal
- Documentation is updated to reflect the removal of memory graph
- No residual imports, function calls, or references to memory graph remain

## Dependencies
- None
