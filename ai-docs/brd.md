# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for MCP Agile Flow

## Document Control
- **Status:** Draft
- **Created:** 2023-03-20
- **Last Updated:** 2023-03-27
- **Version:** 0.3

## Executive Summary

MCP Agile Flow addresses the need for consistent and structured agile workflow management across different IDEs. Development teams struggle with maintaining standardized documentation and workflow processes across tools, leading to inconsistency and reduced productivity. This solution provides a unified framework for managing agile artifacts and documentation templates regardless of the development environment being used.

## Business Objectives

- Improve documentation consistency by standardizing templates across multiple IDEs
- Increase development team productivity by automating document creation and management
- Reduce onboarding time for new team members through consistent documentation structure
- Enhance project transparency by maintaining a clear hierarchy of requirements documentation
- Streamline agile workflow processes across different development environments
- Enable smooth migration between different IDE configurations with conflict resolution

## Market Problem Analysis

- Developers using different IDEs have inconsistent documentation and workflow processes
- Knowledge transfer between teams is hindered by varying document structures
- Project managers lack visibility into unified documentation across development environments
- Requirements traceability is difficult to maintain when documentation formats vary
- Template management across IDEs requires manual effort and leads to inconsistencies
- Moving between different IDE configurations often causes loss of customizations and settings

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Current Progress | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Documentation Consistency | <50% standardized | >95% standardized | ~80% | Template compliance audit |
| Documentation Creation Time | 45 min average | <10 min average | ~15 min | Time tracking of document creation |
| Cross-IDE Knowledge Transfer | Requires significant effort | Seamless | Improved | Developer satisfaction survey |
| Template Maintenance Effort | Manual updates to multiple formats | Single-source update | Achieved | Engineering time allocation |
| Project Setup Time | 2-3 hours | <30 minutes | ~45 minutes | Time to initialize new project |
| IDE Migration Success Rate | <70% with manual effort | >95% automated | ~90% | Migration test success rate |

## Implementation Progress

The current implementation has successfully delivered:

1. **Cross-IDE Template System**: Standardized templates with dynamic discovery and copying across Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and Copilot
2. **IDE Integration Layer**: Adapters for each IDE to ensure consistent rule application
3. **Template Management**: Centralized storage with automatic template detection and versioning
4. **Knowledge Graph Foundation**: Basic entity and relationship tracking for project components
5. **Git Workflow Implementation**: Standardized commit templates and cursor rules with IDE-agnostic implementation ✅
6. **MCP Configuration Migration**: Smart migration tool with conflict detection and resolution ✅
7. **Safe Project Path Handling**: Root directory protections and fallback mechanisms ✅

Ongoing and future work includes:

1. **Enhanced Document Generation**: More automation for document creation and linking
2. **Advanced Knowledge Graph**: Semantic search and deeper contextual awareness
3. **Workflow Automation**: Status tracking and progress visualization
4. **Additional IDE Support**: Potential expansion to other development environments

## Customer Needs

- Developers need consistent documentation regardless of IDE preference
- Project managers need standardized views of project artifacts
- Team leads need to ensure documentation quality across development environments
- New team members need quick access to properly structured documentation
- Organizations need to maintain agile workflows independent of tooling choices
- Teams need to migrate between IDE configurations without losing customizations

## Business Constraints

- Solution must work across multiple popular IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot)
- Implementation must not disrupt existing development workflows
- Must be easy to adopt with minimal training requirements
- Documentation must follow industry standard agile practices
- Solution should be maintainable with minimal ongoing resources
- Migration between IDEs must handle conflicts intelligently

## Assumptions

- Development teams are using agile methodologies
- Organizations value consistent documentation and processes
- Teams have the authority to implement standardized workflows
- Most development environments support Python-based tooling
- IDE preferences will continue to vary among team members
- Teams need flexibility to add custom templates without code changes

## Stakeholders

| Role | Department | Responsibilities |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Development Team Leads | Engineering | Implementation oversight, workflow adoption |
| Project Managers | Product | Documentation requirements, process compliance |
| Developers | Engineering | Daily usage, feedback on usability |
| Technical Writers | Documentation | Template quality, documentation standards |
| DevOps | Operations | Integration with CI/CD pipelines |
