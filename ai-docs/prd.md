# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MCP Agile Flow

## Status
Draft

## Introduction
MCP Agile Flow is a solution designed to standardize agile workflow management and documentation across different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). This product addresses the challenges development teams face when using various IDEs by providing a unified framework for managing agile artifacts, documentation templates, and workflow processes regardless of the development environment being used.

The primary target users include development teams, team leads, project managers, and technical writers who need consistent documentation and workflow processes despite using different IDEs.

## Goals
- Create a cross-IDE compatible system for agile documentation and workflow management
- Reduce documentation creation and maintenance time by 75%
- Achieve 95% standardization of documentation across various development environments
- Decrease project setup time from hours to minutes
- Enable seamless knowledge transfer between team members using different IDEs
- Provide a single source of truth for document templates and workflow rules
