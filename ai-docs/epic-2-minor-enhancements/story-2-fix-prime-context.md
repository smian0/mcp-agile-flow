# Epic-1: Minor Enhancements
# Story-2: Fix Prime Context Tool Directory Handling

## Story Description

**As a** developer using the MCP Agile Flow tools
**I want** the prime_context tool to handle directory paths consistently with other IDE tools
**so that** I can reliably initialize and manage project context across different environments

## Status

âœ… Completed

## Context

The prime_context tool previously failed when trying to determine the project directory, while other IDE tools handle this successfully. This inconsistency has been fixed to ensure a smooth development experience. The tool now uses the same directory resolution logic as the initial IDE setup.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1

## Tasks

1. - [x] Analyze Current Directory Resolution
   1. - [x] Review how other IDE tools handle directory resolution
   2. - [x] Identify the differences in prime_context implementation
   3. - [x] Document the expected behavior

2. - [x] Implement Directory Resolution Fix
   1. - [x] Update prime_context to use consistent directory resolution logic
   2. - [x] Add fallback to current working directory when appropriate
   3. - [x] Add proper error handling for invalid directories

3. - [x] Testing
   1. - [x] Test in root directory scenario
   2. - [x] Test with explicit project path
   3. - [x] Test with environment variable path
   4. - [x] Verify behavior matches other IDE tools

4. - [x] Documentation
   1. - [x] Update tool documentation with directory handling details
   2. - [x] Add examples of proper usage

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing projects
- Should follow the same pattern as other IDE tools
- Must handle both absolute and relative paths correctly

## Dev Notes

The prime_context tool now:
1. First checks for explicit project path parameter
2. Then checks PROJECT_PATH environment variable
3. Finally falls back to current working directory
4. Validates the chosen directory is a valid project directory before proceeding

## Implementation Details

The implementation now uses the `get_safe_project_path` function with proper environment variable handling and error checking. This ensures consistent behavior across all tools and improves reliability when working with different project structures.
