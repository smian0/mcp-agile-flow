# Story-1: Simplify template handling with direct overwriting

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Description
This story involves streamlining the template handling process by ensuring templates are always directly overwritten during initialization without creating backup files, while preserving the backup functionality for important rule files. The simplified approach avoids unnecessary complexity with conditional template overwriting.

## Background Context
When initializing IDE rules and templates, it's important to maintain backups of rule files as they are critical configuration files. However, template files can be safely overwritten during initialization without needing backups since they come from a standard source. By always overwriting templates during initialization without conditional logic, we keep the codebase cleaner and more maintainable while reducing file clutter in the .ai-templates directory.

## Goals
- Simplify the template initialization process
- Ensure templates are always overwritten without creating backup files
- Preserve backup functionality for important rule files
- Reduce file clutter in the .ai-templates directory
- Keep the codebase clean by avoiding unnecessary parameters and conditionals
- Improve code maintainability by clearly separating template and rule handling

## Tasks
- [x] Review the current template initialization logic in `simple_server.py`
- [x] Confirm templates are directly overwritten without creating .back files
- [x] Ensure rule files continue to be backed up for safety
- [x] Simplify template copy logic by removing conditional checks
- [x] Add explicit comments about always overwriting templates
- [x] Verify template overwriting works correctly in all IDE initialization paths
- [x] Test initialization to ensure correct behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- Template initialization completes successfully without creating any .back files
- Rule file initialization continues to create backups for safety
- Templates are always overwritten during IDE initialization
- No new parameters are added for controlling template overwriting
- Code complexity is reduced by removing conditional logic around template handling
- All template files are properly written/updated during initialization
- No errors occur during the initialization process
- The process works consistently across all supported IDEs

## Dev Notes
The implementation uses direct file copying with shutil.copy2() for templates without any backup logic, as shown by the consistent comment across all IDE implementations: "# Copy templates - always overwrite without conditional logic". Rule files maintain their backup functionality through the backup_existing parameter.

The template copying logic has been simplified by removing conditional checks and making the comments more explicit about always overwriting files. Tests only check that templates are copied successfully and exist in the correct location, not whether backups are created, so no test changes were needed.

## Chat Command Log 
- Verified that template files are always overwritten without backup
- Confirmed rule files still maintain backup functionality
- Simplified template copy logic by removing conditional checks
- Made comments more explicit about always overwriting files
- Tested initialization across multiple IDEs to ensure consistent behavior
