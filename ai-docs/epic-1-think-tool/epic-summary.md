## Epic Status: Planning

## Epic Owner
Unassigned

## Description
This epic focuses on enhancing the MCP "think" tool to make it more robust and ensure it's automatically triggered when complex reasoning is required. The enhancements will improve the tool's usability, structure, and effectiveness for handling complex problems.

## Objectives
- Make the think tool automatically trigger for complex reasoning scenarios
- Provide better structure for different types of thinking processes
- Improve the organization and retrievability of recorded thoughts
- Enhance the tool's documentation to guide effective usage

## Technical Considerations
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Should integrate seamlessly with the MCP protocol
- Enhancements should be modular to allow for selective implementation
- Performance impact should be minimal

## Dependencies
- MCP server framework
- Understanding of Claude's reasoning capabilities and limitations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All stories in the epic are completed successfully
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new capabilities
- Unit and integration tests are passing
- Backward compatibility is maintained
