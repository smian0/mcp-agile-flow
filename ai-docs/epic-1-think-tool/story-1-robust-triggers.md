# Story-1: Enhance Think Tool with Robust Triggers

## Story Status: Complete

## Epic Reference
This story is part of [Epic-1-think-tool](../epic-1-think-tool/epic-summary.md): Think Tool Enhancement

## Story Description
As a user of LLM assistants, I want the think tool to be automatically triggered when complex reasoning is required, so that the AI consistently produces better-structured analysis for challenging problems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Enhanced documentation for the think tool with clear trigger signals
- Added thought categorization capability
- Implemented thought templates for different reasoning scenarios
- Added self-assessment mechanism to evaluate when thinking is needed
- Updated tests to verify new functionality
- Added support for "think deeper/harder/more/again" directives

## Story Points
5

## Priority
High

## Assigned To
Unassigned

## Dependencies
- MCP server framework availability
- Understanding of Claude's thinking patterns

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
Enhance the think tool server with the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced Documentation with Clear Trigger Signals**
   - Update tool docstrings with explicit guidance on when to use the tool
   - Include examples of situations requiring structured thinking

2. **Add Thought Categories Parameter**
   - Extend the think tool function to accept a category parameter
   - Modify the thought logging to include categories
   - Update related functions to handle and display categorized thoughts

3. **Add Thought Templates**
   - Implement a new tool function for retrieving thought templates
   - Create templates for common reasoning patterns
   - Document template usage and application

4. **Add Self-Assessment Mechanism**
   - Implement a new tool function to evaluate complexity
   - Create heuristics for identifying complex queries
   - Test with various query types to validate effectiveness

5. **Add Support for Thinking Depth**
   - Implement detection of "think harder", "think deeper", "think more", and "think again" phrases
   - Add depth tracking to thoughts to represent iterations of thinking
   - Create functionality to build on previous thoughts with deeper analysis
   - Establish parent-child relationships between thoughts
   - Allow viewing thoughts organized by their depth chains

### Test Plan
- Unit tests for each new functionality
- Integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow
- Manual testing with a variety of complex queries
- Verify backwards compatibility with existing think tool implementations

## Dev Notes
- Consider impact on performance with additional function calls
- Ensure think tool enhancement doesn't conflict with other MCP tools
- Documentation should clearly communicate the value of each enhancement
